This work on edge detection and obtaining accurate measurements involve two parts 

part I: edge detection and morphological operation
Hand-on training for multi-scale edge detection, such as
Canny and Marr-Hildreth.
part II: assessment of the accuracy of the diameter measurements
Edge detection is useful for delineation of objects. But it has
also limitations, which will be examine.
